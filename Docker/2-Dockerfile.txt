Dockerfile 

It is how we build an Image. Basically a list of instructions.

FROM image -> Base Image
WORKDIR /app -> Working directory inside container
COPY package.json -> Copy files from host/Image
RUN command -> Command executed at build time
CMD ["npm", "start"] -> 'npm start' executed at container start (runtime)


Dockerfile → docker build → Image → docker run → Container


.dockerignore

Same as .gitignore but for Docker builds

Helps speed up builds, reduce Image sizes, and cut security risks

If it shouldn’t be inside the container, add it to .dockerignore (ignore it)
