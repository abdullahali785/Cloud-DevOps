Permissions 

Linux is multi-user so permissions are important

ls -l -> See permissions

chmod -> Change permissions

Permissions 
    (r) Read
    (w) Write
    (e) Execute

Owners 
    (u) Owner of file only
    (g) Users in file's group
    (o) Everyone

Actions
    (+) Add permission
    (-) Remove permission


Symbolic Notation (Letters)
    Format: owner action permission
    chmod u+x file.py -> Owner can run file.py
    chmod g-w file.py -> Group cannot write anymore

Octal Notation (Numbers)
    Three numbers -> u, g, o 
    r=4, w=2, e=1
    Permission = Sum of permissions

    chmod 777 file.py -> user, groups, and others have all permissions
    chmod 744 file.py -> users has full permission, groups and others can only read


chmod -R -> Recursive change of permissions 

chown -> Change owner
chown user:group file.txt
